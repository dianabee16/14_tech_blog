## [Description](#table-of-contents)
This project consists of a CMS-style blog site, where users (usually developers) can publish their blog posts and comment on other usersâ€™ posts as well. The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
